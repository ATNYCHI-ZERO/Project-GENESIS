# Contributing to Project GENESIS

Thank you for your interest in improving this public archive. To help preserve the historical record and maintain the integrity of the documents, please observe the following guidelines when proposing changes:

1. **Preserve Context:** Avoid altering the narrative voice or historical framing of existing documents unless correcting objective errors (such as spelling, grammar, or formatting issues).
2. **Respect Redactions:** Do not attempt to reconstruct or infer redacted material. The redaction notices are intentional and must remain intact.
3. **Document Sources:** If you are adding new material, cite the original source documents or repositories to maintain verifiability.
4. **Use Pull Requests:** Submit changes via pull requests, describing the motivation and scope of your contribution. Ensure that each pull request focuses on a single, self-contained improvement.
5. **Coordinate Major Updates:** For substantial additions or structural changes, open a discussion issue first so that other archivists and custodians can provide feedback.

By following these principles, contributors can help keep Project GENESIS organized, transparent, and historically accurate.
