## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the official research, theory, and computational implementation of Crown Omega Mathematics (K-Math). Its primary purpose is to formalize and validate the principles of K-Math and the **ATNYCHI-KELLY BREAK** as a viable framework for quantum computation and cryptographic analysis.

This project translates the core symbolic operators of K-Math into a hybrid quantum-classical model.

## 2. Technical Framework: The Quantum Model

As discussed, the core of the K-Math quantum model is a two-stage process. This approach is designed to be validated on current NISQ-era quantum hardware.

### Phase 1: `KResonance` (The Phase Operator)
The first step is to encode the harmonic properties of K-Math. This is implemented as a **phase operator** in a quantum circuit.

* **Function:** `KResonance` acts as the "breathing" loop or harmonic-oscillator.
* **Implementation:** This is modeled as a parameterized quantum circuit that manipulates the phase and displacement of qubits, aligning with modern bosonic or cat-state encoding methods.
* **File:** `src/k_math/resonance.py`

### Phase 2: `KHamiltonian` (The Symplectic Step)
Once the `KResonance` loop is established, the `KHamiltonian` is layered on top. This operator introduces dynamic evolution and recursive depth.

* **Function:** `KHamiltonian` applies the core recursive logic of K-Math as a time-evolution step.
* **Implementation:** This is modeled as a **symplectic operator** or a Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation. It applies canonical transformations that preserve phase-space area, directly modeling the core operator evolution of K-Math.
* **File:** `src/k_math/hamiltonian.py`

## 3. Project Goals

1.  **Formalize:** Translate K-Math primitives from theory into testable matrix operators.
2.  **Prototype:** Build and validate the `KResonance` circuit on quantum simulators and hardware.
3.  **Validate:** Demonstrate the `ATNYCHI-KELLY BREAK` by applying the full `KResonance` + `KHamiltonian` model to cryptographic challenges.
